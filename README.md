## [Project 3 (TheOdinProject)](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

The project is aimed to test the skills in JavaScript picked up while working on the course. It also tests the design and implementation of a fun albeit relatively simple game, from scratch by oneself.

### What's to like
My implementation mostly stands out with the design of the UI elements done from scratch by myself, using [Inkscape,](https://inkscape.org/) an opensource vector graphics editor. It was a little bit of a challenge figuring out the implementation of the UI in code, but I was able to do it quite effectively. However, it currently doesn't entirely support or rather, doesn't work as I expect it to on mobile platforms (it still works, very decently).

### What's not to like
The UI also doesn't acknowledge an overall winner over a set number of rounds (like a three-round rock paper scissors one might usually play, for example). It is instead only a round-based winner only being indicated through the use of the graphic elements - so this means it is not an accessible-by-all website. These are things which can be added or improved on in the future, which might or might not happen depending on how I distribute my time.

The end result of the project is hosted [here](https://anupamvamsi.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/), using [github-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
